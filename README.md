Last chance for humanity
========================

### Introduction

Many years ago, the world became dominated by machines after the most ferocious war humanity had ever seen.

Right now, you are one of the few humans who stays alive, and the leader of the machines (a.k.a. LOM) brings you the opportunity to travel back in time to the moment when everything changed.

It is up to you to please LOM to earn another chance for humanity. LOM only ask you to do one thing: Build a program that tests the human's value.

For doing this, LOM brings you a document with the specific requirements of the program, which content is:

*   The program must ask the user at least ten questions with only one correct answer.
*   The questions can be of any kind: a calculation, choose one from multiple choices, text answer, or whatever. But always with a single correct answer.  
    For example:
    *   _"What is the current year?"_ with a number input.
    *   _"12 / 4 ="_ and a selector with options 4, 3, 5.
    *   _"What is the surname of the leading creator of relativity theory called Albert?"_ with a text inputfor type Einstein
*   The user will have only one chance to answer each question.
*   There must be feedback for the user's answer, and if it's wrong, the program must display the correct answer.
*   The program must track user progress to display the answered questions.
*   When the user answers all the questions, the program must display the result of the tests giving him a value of his worthiness.

If the program fits the requirements, humanity will be honored with another chance to prove its value; otherwise, the rest of humanity will be annihilated, and the machines will reign the world forever.

### Technical notes

You can do the exercise as you want; you can use any library or framework to do it; also, you can do it with plain HTML, CSS, and JS.  
You also can improve styles, usability, or performance as far as you want, but always fitting LOM requirements.

To develop the program, you can fork this codepen, create a new one, or even create a new repo on any platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and share it with us.

The requirement here is to use frontend technologies, and the code must be visible and executable so that we can see the result.
